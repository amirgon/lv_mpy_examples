# lv_mpy_examples
This is a preliminary repository of micropython examples for lvgl. It consists of programs from lv_examples that have been ported to micropython.
It is work in progress. Many of the programs have been merged into https://github.com/lvgl/lv_examples
Preliminary code in preparation for a pull request is uploaded here.

Some additional code e.g. image conversions or twatch examples is also available
