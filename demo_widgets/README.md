# Running demo_widgets on the ESP32
This example contains plenty of animations which brings the ESP32 to its limits. When running the program from thonny you may get a timeout error in thonny because the ESP32 does not respond quickly enough on requests that thonny sends it over the serial line. The program works fine however.
In this case you may want to run it with ampy run ex1_demo_widgets.py
